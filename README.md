# Tic-Tac-toe
The Tic Tac Toe project is a simple yet classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. One player uses "X" and the other uses "O". The objective of the game is to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row before the opponent does.
